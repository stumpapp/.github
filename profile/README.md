Stump is a free and open source comics, manga and digital book server with OPDS support

## What is Stump? ü§î

Stump is an open source, self hostable, media server for managing and reading your comic books, manga, and other digital books.

There are some really solid, self-hostable, and **stable** OPDS media servers already out there. Stump started as just a fun side project to learn Rust a bit more seriously. In general, the major goals of Stump are:

- **Speed** - Quick scans, fast loading, etc.
- **Efficiency** - Low memory usage, low CPU usage, etc.
- **Pretty** - A nice UI, with a focus on UX. This is a big one for me, as I am a picky person when it comes to UI/UX.
- **Broad support** - Support for a wide range of comic book and digital book formats, as well as a wide range of metadata formats.

## Project Status

Stump is currently under active development, and is an ongoing **WIP**. Anyone is welcome to try it out, but **do not** expect a fully featured, bug-free experience.

There is a public [development board](https://github.com/users/aaronleopold/projects/2) available that you can check out to see what's being worked on.

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are very **encouraged** and **welcome**! In general, you'll want to follow the [contribution guide](https://www.stumpapp.dev/contributing), which includes a [where to start](https://www.stumpapp.dev/contributing#where-to-start) section in case you're not sure what to work on.

There is also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as) for those interested.

## Tech Stack ü¶Ä

The stack is Rust for the core logic and server application, and React for everything else.

You can find the source code for all of the core Stump apps and services in the [monorepo](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump).
